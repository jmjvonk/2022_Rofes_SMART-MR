# **Information on SNAFU animal scheme - Dutch version**

1. First, the original SNAFU scheme was translated from English to Dutch. Subsequently, animals were added (in Dutch) that were named
   by SMART-MR participants during the animal fluency test. Importantly, those animal names in the scheme might not represent proper terms. For example,
   _bruine raaf_, a brown raven, exists but the name is not referring to a specific species. _Bruine beer_, brown bear, is however referring to a specific
   bear species. Thus, in one case, _bruin_ is an adjective whereas in the other case, it is part of a proper name.
   
2. Rabbits were categorized as both _rodents_ and _rabbits_ although, officially, they are not part of the order Rodentia.
